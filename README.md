# anime_catalog
This is a project for the summer of 2016. I hope to build an application where I can log and look for all the different anime series that I have watched. Plus a bunch more functionality :D

Note: Since this Project is all done on Linux, no Windows, I cant user Visual Studio. So where Visual Studio would generate most of the GUI code for me, I actually have to code the entire things myself. Fun! ;)
