Command Line Compiling

This will tell you how to compile certain programming languages through the command line with no IDE

Programming Language:
	Description

Python:
	Python is one of the easy programming languages to use as it is very simple
	Say we have a file called helloworld.py, inorder to compile this all we have to do is
	For Python 2:
		python helloworld.py
	For Python 3:
		python3 helloworld.py

C:
	For this you need to make sure that you have gcc installed on your system as that is the compiler for c programs
	So inorder to compile a program file called helloworld.c
	Firstly we compile it to an object file like this
		gcc helloworld.c ((-o helloworld) add this part if you need to name the file something specific, in this case the compiled object file will be called helloworld
							if this is not included then the object file will be called a)
	Then all we have to do is call the object line through out command line like so
		./helloworld
	Then it will show the file output

C++:
	This is very similar to how you compile a C program but you need to the g++ compiler rather than gcc
	File: helloworld.cpp
	As before it compiles the file into an object file and then from there run the object files
	Compiling
		g++ helloworld.cpp ((-o helloworld) add this part if you need to name the file something specific, in this case the compiled object file will be called helloworld
							if this is not included then the object file will be called a)
	Running
		./helloworld

C#:
	C# is a little more complicated as it can involve several different compiling enviroments such as normal, Gtk, WinForms but we will cover all of these
	Note:
		Inorder to do this on linux you need to make sure you have mono installed as that has all of the .net libarys and dlls for you to use, otherwise it just wouldn't work properly

	Normal:
		File: helloworld.cs
		Compile:
			mcs helloworld.cs
		Run:
			mono helloworld.exe

	WinForms:
		File: helloworld.case
		Compile: 
			mcs helloworld.cs -pkg:dotnet -lib:/usr/lib/mono/2.0
		Run:
			mono helloworld.exe	

VB.Net:
	This also requires mono to be installed as it requires the .net framework
	File: helloworld.vb
	Compile:
		vbnc helloworld.vb
	Run:
		mono helloworld.exe

NASM Assembly:
	Before this you need to make sure you have the NASM assembler installed on your machine before you do anything
	File: helloworld.nasm

	First you need to compile it assinto a object file:
		nasm-f elf helloworld.asm
	Then you need to link it to an executable. Note this step is different depending on the system you have installed
	32-bit(x86):
		ld -s -o hello helloworld.o
	64-bit(x86_64):
		ld -m elf_i386 -s -o hello helloworld.o
	In both of these cases the executable will be called hello
	To execute your file you just:
		./hello
